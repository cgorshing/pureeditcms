/// Note from Michael Dick ///

This is very important if you plan to modify TinyMCE to your own preferences. I have stripped down TinyMCE to it's bare bones and removed any files that PureEdit does not use including all pluigins. You will need to download and re-install TinyMCE if you plan to customize it.

Thanks,
